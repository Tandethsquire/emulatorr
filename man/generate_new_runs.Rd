  emulators,

\arguments{
\item{emulators}{A list of \code{\link{Emulator}} objects, trained on the design points}

\item{ranges}{The ranges of the input parameters}

\item{n_points}{Optional. Specifies how many additional points are required. Default: 10*(number of emulators)}

\item{n_runs}{Optional. Number of sampling runs to perform. Default = 100}

\item{z}{Optional. If given, checks implausibility of sample points to restrict to only non-implausible points.}

\item{cutoff}{Optional. If z is given, this is the implausibility cutoff for the filtering}

\item{x}{Required if method is 'slice'. A starting point for the sampling}

\item{method}{'lhs' or 'slice'}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the set of new points to simulate at.
}
\description{
Given a set of trained emulators, finds the next set of points that will be informative
for the next wave of emulators.
}
\details{
If the method is LHS, this creates a new training set using LHS, and
then finds the trace of the variance matrix of the emulators across these points (this is
broadly equivalent to using V-optimality). We repeat this for \code{n_runs}, and select
the configuration that minimises the mean of the variances across the emulators.
If observations are given, then these are used to ensure that the new sample points are
non-implausible according to the current emulators.

Alternatively, we may use slice sampling: given the emulators and a known
non-implausible point, generate more by sampling uniformly over the minimum enclosing
hyperrectangle, and ensuring that the resulting point is implausible.

For any sampling strategy, the parameters \code{emulators} and \code{ranges} must be
specified. If the method is 'slice', then the parameters \code{x}
and \code{z} are necessary. All other parameters are optional.
